What are the main principles of OOP?

Encapsulation involves bundling data (properties) and methods
into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps hide the 
internal implementation details of an object and provides a well-
definded interface for interacting with the object.

Abstraction focuse on the esential features of an object, hiding
the unnecessary details. It allows you to create abstract classes
and interfaces that define a contract without specifying the implementation details.

Inheritance allows a derived class to inherit properties and methods from a base
class. It promotes code reuse and helps create hierarchical relationships between classes.

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common 
superclass. It allows you to write more generic and flexible code that can work with objects of different types.
